    # Telescope is a fuzzy finder that comes with a lot of different things that
    # it can fuzzy find! It's more than just a "file finder", it can search
    # many different aspects of Neovim, your workspace, LSP, and more!
    #
    # The easiest way to use Telescope, is to start by doing something like:
    #  :Telescope help_tags
    #
    # After running this command, a window will open up and you're able to
    # type in the prompt window. You'll see a list of `help_tags` options and
    # a corresponding preview of the help.
    #
    # Two important keymaps to use while in Telescope are:
    #  - Insert mode: <c-/>
    #  - Normal mode: ?
    #
    # This opens a window that shows you all of the keymaps for the current
    # Telescope picker. This is really useful to discover what Telescope can
    # do as well as how to actually do it!
    #
    # [[ Configure Telescope ]]
    # See `:help telescope` and `:help telescope.setup()`

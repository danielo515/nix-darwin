--- FileWatcher:watchDirectory(directory, rules)
--- Method
--- Start watching a directory with the specified rules
---
--- Parameters:
---  * directory - Directory path to watch
---  * rules - Array of rules to apply to matching files
---
--- Returns:
---  * The FileWatcher object
---
--- Notes:
---  * Each rule should be a table with the following keys:
---    * pattern - Lua pattern to match filename (case-insensitive)
---    * destination - Path where matching files should be moved
---    * action - (optional) Action to take, currently only "move" is supported (default: "move")
---  * The directory path can use tilde (~) for the home directory
---  * Files are moved automatically when they appear in the watched directory
---  * If a file with the same name exists at the destination, a number will be appended
function obj:watchDirectory(directory, rules)
	-- Expand the directory path
	directory = expandTilde(directory)

--- FileWatcher:stopWatching(directory)
--- Method
--- Stop watching a directory
---
--- Parameters:
---  * directory - Directory path to stop watching
---
--- Returns:
---  * The FileWatcher object
function obj:stopWatching(directory)
	directory = expandTilde(directory)
	directory = ensureTrailingSlash(directory)

--- FileWatcher:stopAllWatchers()
--- Method
--- Stop all directory watchers
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None

	end
	return self
end

--- FileWatcher:start()
--- Method
--- Starts all configured directory watchers
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * The FileWatcher object
---
--- Notes:
---  * This method is provided for consistency with other Spoons
---  * Watchers are automatically started when you call :watchDirectory()
function obj:start()
	-- Watchers are started automatically in watchDirectory
	-- This method is here for API consistency
	return self
end

--- FileWatcher:stop()
--- Method
--- Stops all directory watchers
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * The FileWatcher object
